Jean-Marc Delisle<br>
EXSM3949 - Python Project<br>
Due September 27/22<br>

Different language base and making a user input to enter data to create a plot chart. Created readme and as well my first .py along with some data.
I am mostly finished the project with having styles needed to be put in place and option 2 on how they want it implemented.

When doing the manual data entry, on the x-axis and y axis, you must enter as followed 1,2,3,4;

Follow through each question as per and when you hit line/marker style, use only the number to get the styles.<br>
Couldn't get line and marker to work for some reason.<br>
Came across some issue where I could not run option 2 till Arv had assisted me, my naming syntax was incorrect up.<br>
--Thank you Arv--
